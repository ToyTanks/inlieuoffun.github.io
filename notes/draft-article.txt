The [[Zoom Video Communications|Zoom]] link changes monthly, viewers can find the current link through the show's [[Twitter]] account at [https://twitter.com/inlieuoffunshow @inlieuoffunshow] [[Zoom Video Communications|Zoom]] views are able to pose questions to the hosts and guests through [[Zoom Video Communications|Zoom's]] Q&A function. An early experience with Zoom "[[Zoombombing|bombers]]" resulted in the disabling of the [[Zoom Video Communications|Zoom]] chat feature and the hosts ignoring Zoom viewers who use the "raise the hand" feature. On July 11, 2020, the show transitioned to using [https://www.crowdcast.io/discover Crowdcast] rather than [[Zoom Video Communications|Zoom]] as their main platform, simultaneously streaming on [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]], and [[Periscope (app)|Periscope]].

== History ==
As the COVID-19 restrictions went into effect in the U.S. during March of 2020, this daily video podcast was launched as way for a group of friends and acquaintances to continue to meet and discuss news events and other topics.<ref>{{Cite web|title=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8lKFNnYE1War3a41Q41fMw|access-date=2020-06-27|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

== Content ==
The podcast typically covers topics of national interest, often drawing upon the hosts' experience in legal analyses<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-03-24|title=Kate Klonick {{!}} Berkman Klein Center|url=https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/kate-klonick|access-date=2020-06-27|website=cyber.harvard.edu|language=en}}</ref> and journalism.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Benjamin Wittes|title=Benjamin Wittes|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/author/benjamin-wittes/|access-date=2020-06-27|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US}}</ref> Guests are invited to talk about whatever they choose, but current events often frame the conversation. Announced guests appear during weekdays, the hosts appear without guests on Saturdays, and "Mystery Guests" appear on Sundays, as the hosts alternate surprising one another with an unannounced guest.
