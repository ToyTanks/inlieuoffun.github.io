    "detail": "Sarah Longwell returns to discuss the DNC convention which concludes this\nevening, but is derailed because Kate was offline all day and hadn't heard [why\nSteven K. Bannon had a rough day today][wsj]. Ben reminded all that the charges are\nunproven, but merriment ensured nevertheless. Sarah discusses also focus group\ninsights, to include the fact that a number of Trump voters have not been\nfocused heretofore on his public statements - but the combination of daily\nappearances and quarantine is exposing them now to an unfiltered view of the\npresident. Tune in to hear how that went.\n\n[wsj]: https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-senior-trump-advisor-steve-bannon-charged-with-alleged-fundraising-scheme-11597931727"
