    "detail": "Both a master potter and designer, Eric is focused on a constant refinement of\nboth form and technique. For him, the one cannot evolve naturally without the\nother. His love for wheel thrown pottery started already at age 16 and has\nevolved into a way of life, his vocation.\n\nFor Eric, shaping objects by hand is not a look back at the past. He firmly\nbelieves that hand-crafting objects of a timeless value is a way forward. Eric\nis a graduate of the Danish school of Design in Copenhagen and has been awarded\nwith a number of grants, international exhibition selections, and other\ndistinguishments for the quality of his work."
