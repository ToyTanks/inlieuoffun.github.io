    "detail": "Carl Bergstrom is a professor of biology at the University of Washington. At a\nbiological level he studies how communication evolves and how the process of\nevolution encodes information in genomes, but he also looks at how norms and\ninstitutions influence research strategies and our scientific understanding of\nthe world.\n\nHis most recent book with Jevin D. West is called “[Calling Bullshit][cb]” and\noutlines a powerful set of tools to better assess misinformation, disinformation,\nfake news, and bad science.\n\nHe's also really into crows and ravens.\n\n[cb]: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/563882/calling-bullshit-by-carl-t-bergstrom-and-jevin-d-west/\n\n### Corvid References\n\n- [@corvidresearch](https://twitter.com/corvidresearch) (Dr. Kaeli Swift)\n- [Corvid research blog](https://corvidresearch.blog/)\n- [Gifts of the Crow](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Gifts-of-the-Crow/John-Marzluff/9781439198742)"
