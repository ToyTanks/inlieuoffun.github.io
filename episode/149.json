    "detail": "Ben has a present for Kate, which comes in the form of having planned the\nentire upcoming week of *In Lieu of Fun* ahead of time. There's some question\nwhether this is technically allowed by The Rules, but we'll allow it.\n\nOur hosts then address a vibrant list of suggested future guests, before diving\ninto some difficult questions posed by an audience member that challenges Ben\nand Kate to answer questions about each other. Fortunately, it turns out your\nhosts like each other, so the answers were enjoyable.\n\nThen things took a more serious turn, when someone asked Kate & Ben to comment\nabout the baffling rise of QAnon from being a fringe conspiracy theory to a set\nof talking points that elected candidates are speaking up for. Ben has some\npersonal context for the dangers posed by the movement, and offers a very\nmoving and detailed discussion.\n\nThe episode wrapped up with Kate's expert quick take on the new [Twitter\nTransparency Center](https://transparency.twitter.com), and some thoughts on\nthe challenges faced by the Democratic Party in the 2020 election, keeping its\nconstituency focused in the face of its breadth."
