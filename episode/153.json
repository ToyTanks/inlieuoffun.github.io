    "detail": "Rick is one of the nation’s leading scholars of constitutional law and a\nspecialist in legal issues concerning democracy. A former law clerk to Justice\nThurgood Marshall, he has been elected into the American Academy of Arts and\nSciences and the American Law Institute, and has also received recognition as a\nGuggenheim Fellow and a Carnegie Scholar.\n\nIn dozens of articles and his acclaimed casebook, The Law of Democracy, he has\nhelped create an entirely new field of study in the law schools. His work in\nthis field systematically explores legal and policy issues concerning the\nstructure of democratic elections and institutions, such as the role of money\nin politics, the design of election districts, the regulation of political\nparties, the structure of voting systems, the representation of minority\ninterests in democratic institutions, and similar issues.\n\nHe has written on the rise of political polarization in the United States, the\ntransformation of the presidential nominations process, the Voting Rights Act\n(including editing a book titled The Future of the Voting Rights Act), the\ndysfunction of America’s political processes, the role of the Supreme Court in\noverseeing American democracy, and the powers of the American President and\nCongress. In addition to his scholarship in these areas, he has written on\nnational-security law, the design of the regulatory state, and American\nconstitutional history and theory.\n\nAs a lawyer, Pildes has successfully argued voting-rights and election-law\ncases before the United States Supreme Court and the courts of appeals, and as\na well-known public commentator, he writes frequently for The New York Times,\nThe Washington Post, and was part of the Emmy-nominated NBC breaking-news team\nfor coverage of the 2000 Bush v. Gore contest."
