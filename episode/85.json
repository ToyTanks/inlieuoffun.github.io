    "detail": "Belew specializes in the recent history of the United States, examining the\nlong aftermath of warfare. Her first book, *Bring the War Home: The White Power\nMovement and Paramilitary America* (Harvard, 2018), explores how white power\nactivists wrought a cohesive social movement through a common story about the\nVietnam War and its weapons, uniforms, and technologies. By uniting previously\ndisparate Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazi, skinhead, and other groups, the movement\ncarried out escalating acts of violence that ricocheted through Latin America,\nsouthern Africa, and the United States, revealing white power as a\ntransnational phenomenon.\n\n*Bring the War Home* shows how this paramilitary fringe movement augmented,\nclashed with, and challenged other militarizations in the same time period,\nincluding paramilitary foreign policy and extralegal intervention, militarized\npolicing, and the growth of the carceral state. White power activists often\ncollided with refugees displaced by US warfare, and reinforced state border\npatrols at home and covert interventions abroad. While some have understood\nthese actors as part of a culture of masculinity, white power paramilitarism\nwas also a cohesive social movement comprising a wide range of activists and\nsupporters, including women and families. This account connects the overtly\nracist organizing of the 1980s with the militia movement, culminating in the\n1995 Oklahoma City bombing."
