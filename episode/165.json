    "detail": "It being Labor Day, we’re joined by Cynthia Estlund, a professor at New York\nUniversity Law School and a leading scholar of labor and employment law and\nworkplace governance.\n\nEstlund's current work focuses on automation and the future of work. Her latest\nbook, \"A New Deal for China’s Workers?\" (2017), takes a comparative look at\nlabor unrest and reform in China. In her previous book, \"Regoverning the\nWorkplace: From Self-Regulation to Co-Regulation\" (2010), she chronicled the\ncurrent crisis of workplace governance in the US and charted a potential path\nforward. Her first book, \"Working Together: How Workplace Bonds Strengthen a\nDiverse Democracy\" (2003), explored the implications of integration,\ncooperation, and sociability among co-workers for democratic theory and for the\nlaw of work.\n\nOther writings focus on freedom of speech and procedural fairness at work;\ndiversity, integration, and affirmative action; critical perspectives on labor\nlaw; and transnational labor rights and regulation."
