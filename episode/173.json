McClatchy Professor of Law at Stanford Law School and a\nnationally recognized scholar of constitutional law, election law, and the\ndemocratic process.\n\nTucker is a professor of politics at NYU, where he also serves as the Director\nof the Jordan Center for the Advanced Study of Russia and Co-Director of the\nNYU Social Media and Political Participation (SMaPP) lab. Their new book,\nexamines the last five years, in which widespread concern about the effects of\nsocial media on democracy has led to an explosion in research from different\ndisciplines and corners of academia. The book covers a broad set of topics from\ndisinformation to hate speech to political advertisingâ€”and situates recent\ndevelopments in the context of key policy questions and reform.\n\n[book]: https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/E79E2BBF03C18C3A56A5CC393698F117\n[bookpdf]: https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/E79E2BBF03C18C3A56A5CC393698F117/9781108835558AR.pdf/Social_Media_and_Democracy.pdf\n\n### Related Reading\n\n- [The Butterfly Did It](http://sekhon.berkeley.edu/papers/butterfly.pdf), an\n  analysis of the problems with butterfly-ballot voting machines in Florida in\n  the 2000 election.\n\n- [Elections & Democracy in the Digital Age](https://storage.googleapis.com/kofiannanfoundation.org/2019/02/a6112278-190206_kaf_democracy_internet_persily_single_pages_v3.pdf)\n\n- [From Liberation to Turmoil: Social Media & Democracy](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/from-liberation-to-turmoil-social-media-and-democracy/)"
